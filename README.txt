This project is implementing cage-based 2D animation using mean-value coordinates. 

To run this project:
run the python file: make-cage.py
then run: http-server dist -c-1

To use this program, click where on the screen you want the points that will form the cage. It will form the
cage as you click. Then press key 'o' in order to lock in the cage. This means whatever the cage is currently is
going to be the cage of the underformed image. This also means you can not add anymore points to the cage. Then to
modify the cage and therefore modify the image, click any of the handles of the cage and click where you want to move
it to. That will move the cage and change the image. To add a keyframe press key 'k'. Then to play the animation,
press key 'p'. 

The contents of this submission includes:
- A python file to compile the program
- src folder that contain src files for the program
